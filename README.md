| **Purpose of Website** | What is the purpose and goal of the website?                               | To provide effective, easy to follow guides for good cyber hygiene to protect identity, avoid scams/phishing, protect personal data as well as personal safety in the digital world and in real life                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Target Audience**    | Describe the target audience (age, gender, demographics)                   | New and returning students at NCAT. General demographics of local traditional students with an emphasis for remote students more dependent on online resources (example demos of NCAT are 14k students, 40/60 male to female, ages range from 18-35, with majority 18-24. Racial ethnic cybersecurity beginner tutorials website (good for multiple subjects and pages) distributions: 80% Black or African American, 6% White, 4% Hispanic or Latino and remaining multi-ethnic or unreported, as well as Asian and Pacific Island students making up the remaining 10%. (Data USA 2023) \*\*\* The vast majority of degrees are in software development, management, engineering, so (Data USA 2023) , the audience may be assumed to be technically familiar with many basic computer and software subjects, so focusing in on practical, ready-to-deploy solutions that can work in a professional setting, where cybersecurity touches many daily parts of the job (ex: SecDevOps and IoT and FPGA deployment for SCADA monitoring systems), can be marketed as a job skill for interviews and best practices for those already in the field. |
